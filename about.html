    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Jett Paul Vaughan</strong>. I’m from a small town in East Texas right off Highway 80 called <strong>Mineola</strong>. After graduating from Mineola High School, I continued my education at <strong>Tyler Junior College</strong>, where I earned my <strong>Associate of Arts in Advertising and Public Relations</strong>. While at TJC, I was part of the TJC Band and played the <strong>baritone saxophone</strong>. In 2024, I was invited by my high school to perform with them at <strong>TMEA</strong>.
      <br><br>
      During my time in Tyler, I worked at <strong>Willow Brook Country Club</strong> as a server in their premier steakhouse, where I also helped create a few ads for the club. After completing my studies at TJC, I moved to <strong>Denton, Texas</strong>, to attend the <strong>University of North Texas</strong>, where I’m majoring in <strong>Advertising</strong> and minoring in <strong>Journalism</strong>.
      <br><br>
      With my degrees, I plan to work on <strong>political campaigns</strong> as part of a <strong>public relations team</strong>. I also aspire to join an <strong>advertising agency</strong>—whether it be <strong>Loomis</strong> or <strong>Miller Ad Agency</strong>, both based in Dallas, Texas. Eventually, I hope to earn my <strong>Master’s degree</strong> from either the <strong>University of Missouri</strong> or the <strong>University of Texas at Austin</strong>.
      <br><br>
      I plan to use this website to <strong>showcase my code</strong> and serve as a <strong>portfolio for my future endeavors</strong>.
