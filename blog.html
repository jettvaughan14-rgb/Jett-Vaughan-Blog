    <h2>“Hide Ya Kids, Hide Ya Wife” — Media Ethics Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t think this topic is funny whatsoever. What makes this story comical is the tone of his voice while describing “Hide ya kids, hide ya wives, and hide ya husband.” 
      I feel like the news station chose to focus on Antoine because of the shock factor. Sadly, the majority of media nowadays focuses on what will get the views. 
      Honestly, in my eyes I don’t think this story broke the SPJ’s Code of Ethics. Although it does minimize harm, it seems as if it was an unrehearsed and honest interview, delivered by a primary source.

    <h2>Beyond the Surface: What Feminism and Beauty Really Mean</h2>
    <p>
      Both Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s <em>“We Should All Be Feminists”</em> and Cameron Russell’s <em>“Looks Aren’t Everything: Believe Me, I’m a Model”</em> make powerful points about how society defines people—especially women—and how those definitions hold us back. 
      Adichie explains how girls are taught to make themselves smaller, to be ambitious but not too ambitious, to be likable but never assertive. Her message is simple: feminism isn’t about anger or superiority—it’s about fairness. 
      Cameron Russell takes that same honesty and applies it to beauty and privilege. She admits she “won the genetic lottery,” yet points out how looks are a form of currency that come with both benefits and pressure. She exposes how the modeling industry sells an illusion—perfect lighting, editing, and angles—and how people mistake that for real confidence. 
      What connects both talks is the idea that image and identity are constructed. Adichie calls out gender roles that limit our potential, while Russell reveals the false perfection that media sells. Both challenge us to look deeper—to value honesty, intelligence, and individuality over surface-level approval. 
      For me, these talks go hand in hand. They remind us that confidence isn’t about fitting the mold—it’s about breaking it. Feminism and authenticity belong together because they both fight the same thing: the need to perform for acceptance. When we stop trying to meet society’s idea of who we should be, we finally make room to become who we really are.
